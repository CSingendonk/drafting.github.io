#super pong
- 2 or 4 paddle play choice, vs ai choice, win conditions / game mode selections and implimentations added, power ups refined, score keeping refined, left and top paddles move with wasd right and bottom paddles move with up dowmn left right arrows, spacebar launches ball after a point is scored or a new game is started. ballspeed input element controls speed of the ball, just to be clear? XD 

mazepage - customizable randomized regenerating maze - arrow keys / ui

pong game - pong v2 works best - arrows up/down = right paddle + 'W'/'S' = left paddle -- changing speed launches ball horizontally in opposite direction of most recent side that was scored against ( im pretty sure iirc i dunno )
-- note: upon further investigation and actually testing the pong games, might be good for like a sunday afternoon 'make it work' kinda thing. Super Pong however is more like a ' oooo, maybe  I will add this, or will that just break it?' kinda thing.

repo c# files - ones i actually use for stupid shit => playerscript , movement , mazegenerator , rotatecontroller , hotkeyhandlers , exittrigger
