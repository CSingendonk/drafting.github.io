mazepage - customizable randomized regenerating maze - arrow keys / ui

pong game - pong v2 works best - arrows up/down = right paddle + 'W'/'S' = left paddle -- changing speed launches ball horizontally in opposite direction of most recent side that was scored against ( im pretty sure iirc i dunno )
-- note: upon further investigation and actually testing the pong games, might be good for like a sunday afternoon 'make it work' kinda thing. Super Pong however is more like a ' oooo, maybe  I will add this, or will that just break it?' kinda thing.

repo c# files - ones i actually use for stupid shit => playerscript , movement , mazegenerator , rotatecontroller , hotkeyhandlers , exittrigger
