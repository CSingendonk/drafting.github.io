mazepage - customizable randomized regenerating maze - arrow keys / ui

pong game - pong v2 works best - arrows up/down = right paddle + 'W'/'S' = left paddle -- changing speed launches ball horizontally in opposite direction of most recent side that was scored against ( im pretty sure iirc i dunno )

repo c# files - most important == playerscript , movement , mazegenerator , rotatecontroller , hotkeyhandlers , exittrigger
